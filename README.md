# Static Site Builder

Build a HTML website from markdown files.

This gem will convert your markdown files into HTML files, embedding the generated HTML into a template (making up the full webpage). This gem's default [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) template will be used unless you specify a template of your own. More on this further down.

## Installation

    $ gem install static_site_builder

This will add an executable called `site_builder` to your `$PATH`.

## Usage

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/my_site
$ cd ~/my_site
$ echo "# My Amazing Website" >> index.md
$ site_builder build
Site built with 1 HTML file(s):
./index.html
$ open index.html
```

That's it! In this instance, there will be a newly generated mobile friendly `index.html` file in the same directory.

Of course, you can specify an input and output directory as well as a custom HTML template to use instead of the default one.

For full usage of `site_builder`, see:

    $ site_builder help build

## Templating

The default template uses Bootstrap 4.1 to enable a stylish and responsive website design out of the box.

Custom templates are simply HTML files which include an editable region (inside a `<body>` tag) consisting of the following markdown:

```html
<div id="editable_region"></div>
```

The editable region `div` will be replaced with the generated HTML from your markdown.

Of course you can include anything else that's common to your site in your template e.g.

- Navigation menu
- Links to your own style sheets
- Javascript applying to the whole site
- etc...

If using your own template, you must ensure it's valid HTML and that it contains the editable region `div` seen above. That's it.

You can use this gem's built in [default template](https://github.com/michaeltelford/static_site_builder/blob/master/templates/default_template.html) as an example.

## Development

I welcome community contribution as long as the changes makes sense.

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `*.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
